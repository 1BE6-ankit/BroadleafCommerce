Overview of common functionality shared by List Pages within the Broadleaf admin.


== Introduction

Every Admin "section" (Products, Catalogs, Offers, Content Items, etc.) will bring to you a page were all the section
items are listed out. For this guide, we call these pages "List Pages".

== Anatomy of a List Page

#<5>#:: Filter Button (see: <<Filtering the List Page>> )
#<6>#:: Field name and sorting button

== Filtering the List Page

List Pages can be filtered to only allow, or exclude, certain items on the page.
