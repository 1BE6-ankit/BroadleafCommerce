This guide will teach you about the basic make-up of an Admin Page

== Overview

The Admin Item/Entity Pages are where an admin user can edit and view all the information about any one particular
item/entity. The content, and style, of each Admin Page is dependent on what item/entity is being displayed, the
current admin user's link:documentation/roles[Admin Roles and Permissions], and whatever custom development has been
been for the application. This guide will show some basic out-of-box features relating to Admin Item/Entity Pages (Admin
Pages).

== Anatomy of an Admin Page

An Admin Page is generally made up of four parts.

== Breadcrumb/Navigation Bar

The navigation bar displays the admin user's current path/location within the applications.

== Delete Button

== Save Button


== Tabs

The Tabs are were all related <<Field Groups>> reside. While the available tabs will differ depending on item being
viewed, *_most_* pages will contain the following three tabs (in order of likelihood)

* General
* Audit
* Advanced

The *General* tab will always be displayed by default and will always have a default "general" <<Field Groups, Field Group>>.

The *Audit* tab will generally contain information of when they item was created, last updated, and by whom.

The *Advanced* tab is a generic tab that contains different <<Field Groups>> depending on the item.

== Field Groups

Field Groups are where concept related <<Fields>> are grouped together to be contained and displayed with a <<Tabs, Tab>>.
Some <<Field Groups>> can have toggled visibility while others will always remain visible. Some <<Field Groups>> may also have a label on them
while others may not. The default *General* <<Field Groups, Field Group>> is displayed on every <<Tabs, Tab>>
as a static <<Field Groups, Field Group>> without a label.

== Fields

A <<Fields, Field>> is where users view and edit the data that comprises the item being viewed. The look, style, and
values a <<Fields, Field>> can store varies depending the how the Admin Application is customized.
